To use E Speaking, you need to download and install the software from their website[^5^]. You also need to have Microsoft's SAPI and .NET Framework installed on your computer[^5^]. After installing the software, you need to activate it using a serial key that you can generate using a keygen program[^1^].
 
A keygen program is a software that creates unique serial keys for a specific software. It is often used to bypass the registration or activation process of a software. However, using a keygen program is illegal and may expose your computer to malware or viruses. Therefore, we do not recommend using a keygen program to activate E Speaking or any other software.
 
If you want to use E Speaking legally and safely, you should purchase a license from their website[^4^]. A license costs $14 for one year or $24 for lifetime[^4^]. By purchasing a license, you will also get technical support and updates from the developers[^4^]. You will also avoid any legal or security risks associated with using a keygen program.
 
In conclusion, E Speaking is a voice recognition software that can help you control your computer, dictate emails and letters, and have the computer read documents back to you. However, you should not use a keygen program to activate it, as it is illegal and unsafe. Instead, you should buy a license from their website and enjoy the benefits of using E Speaking legally and securely.
